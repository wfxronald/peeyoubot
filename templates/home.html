        <p class="mt-3">Head to <code>Telegram</code> now and add <kbd>@peeyoubot</kbd> to start tracking your clears. Track your grind in a systematic manner!</p>
        <p>This project aims to collect the order someone clears songs in a certain folder. Given that a relatively easier chart is likely to be cleared earlier, the data collected by the bot can be used to generate a tier list, with songs that are cleared later by most people classified as hard, and vice versa.</p>
        <p>The current progress of the tier list (updated real-time) can be seen <a href="http://peeyouweb.herokuapp.com/">here</a></p>
